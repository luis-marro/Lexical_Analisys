# Lexical_Analisys
This repository contains the first stage on making a full compiler, which is a mini c# lexical analyzer. 

## Sofware Usage 
1. Load the file: Select a file from the file explorer using the "Explorar" 
button. The lexical analizer takes as input any mini c# program regardless of the file extension. 
2. Scan and generate the output for the lexical analyzer using the 
"Evaluar" button. What this button does is generate a lexical analyzer 
using Jflex (compiled in runtime) and produces a file with all the tokens found 
located in the same folder as the input but with a .out extension. 
3. After the analysis, you can select another file and repeat the process.
